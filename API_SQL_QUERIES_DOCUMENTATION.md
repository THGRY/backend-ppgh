# Complete API SQL Queries Documentation

This document contains all SQL queries used across the APIs with their purposes, metrics, and business logic.

## Overview
- **Total APIs**: 11 endpoints
- **Total SQL Queries**: 11 main queries (OPTIMIZED versions)
- **Database**: Azure MSSQL Server (pythia)
- **Main Table**: `preprocessed.pageviews_partitioned`
- **Secondary Table**: `pythia_db.currencies` (for exchange rates)

## ðŸš€ LATEST OPTIMIZATIONS (2025-09-12)
- **Unique Visitors**: Replaced with CTE and BETWEEN clause
- **Total Bookings**: Optimized with CROSS APPLY instead of UNION
- **Room Nights**: Updated to use BETWEEN instead of >= AND <=
- **Revenue**: Optimized with CROSS APPLY for better performance
- **Performance Impact**: Significant speed improvements on all core metrics

## 1. L1 SUMMARY DATA API
**Endpoint**: `/api/l1-summary-data`  
**Purpose**: Returns all 5 key metrics in parallel  
**Uses**: All queries 1-5 below

---

## 2. UNIQUE VISITORS METRIC
**Endpoint**: `/api/l1-unique-visitors`  
**Metric**: Total distinct website visitors  
**Business Logic**: Count unique client IDs in date range

```sql
WITH filtered_pageviews AS (
    SELECT 
        td_client_id
    FROM preprocessed.pageviews_partitioned
    WHERE 
        td_client_id IS NOT NULL
        AND td_client_id != ''
        AND time BETWEEN ${fromTimestamp} AND ${toTimestamp}
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT td_client_id) AS unique_visitors
FROM filtered_pageviews
```

**Performance**: Direct query, no caching

---

## 3. TOTAL BOOKINGS METRIC
**Endpoint**: `/api/l1-total-bookings`  
**Metric**: Total completed bookings with confirmation numbers  
**Business Logic**: Count unique confirmation numbers from both confirmation columns

```sql
WITH filtered AS (
    SELECT booking_transaction_confirmationno, booking_transaction_confirmationno_1
    FROM preprocessed.pageviews_partitioned
    WHERE time BETWEEN ${fromTimestamp} AND ${toTimestamp}
      AND (
            (booking_transaction_confirmationno IS NOT NULL AND booking_transaction_confirmationno != '')
         OR (booking_transaction_confirmationno_1 IS NOT NULL AND booking_transaction_confirmationno_1 != '')
      )
),
unified AS (
    SELECT v.confirmation_no
    FROM filtered
    CROSS APPLY (VALUES
        (booking_transaction_confirmationno),
        (booking_transaction_confirmationno_1)
    ) AS v(confirmation_no)
    WHERE v.confirmation_no IS NOT NULL AND v.confirmation_no != ''
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT confirmation_no) AS total_bookings
FROM unified
```

**Performance**: Smart caching enabled

    ISNULL(TRY_CAST(booking_bookingwidget_totalnightstay_1 AS FLOAT), 0)
  ) as room_nights
FROM preprocessed.pageviews_partitioned
WHERE time BETWEEN ${fromTimestamp} AND ${toTimestamp}
  AND (
    booking_bookingwidget_totalnightstay IS NOT NULL OR

        v.currency_code
    FROM preprocessed.pageviews_partitioned p
    CROSS APPLY (VALUES
        (p.booking_transaction_totalpayment, p.booking_transaction_currencytype),
        (p.booking_transaction_totalpayment_1, p.booking_transaction_currencytype_1)
    ) AS v(payment, currency_code)
    WHERE time BETWEEN ${fromTimestamp} AND ${toTimestamp}
      AND v.payment IS NOT NULL
      AND v.payment != ''
      AND TRY_CAST(v.payment AS FLOAT) > 0
)
SELECT
    SUM(
        payment_data.payment_amount *
        CASE
            WHEN UPPER(payment_data.currency_code) = 'USD' THEN 1.0
            ELSE COALESCE(c.exchange_rate_to_usd, 1.0)
        END
    ) AS total_revenue_usd
FROM payment_data
LEFT JOIN pythia_db.currencies c
    ON UPPER(c.code) = UPPER(payment_data.currency_code)

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Sampling Strategy
- **Chart Queries**: Use 2% TABLESAMPLE for speed
- **Scale Factor**: Multiply results by 50 to estimate full dataset
- **Target Response**: <1000ms for chart queries

### Caching Strategy
- **Key Metrics**: Smart caching with chunk aggregation
- **Chart Data**: Direct queries (no caching for reliability)

### Index Usage
- **Primary Index**: `[time, td_client_id]` for filtering
- **Partitioning**: Table is partitioned by time for performance

### Data Types
- **Timestamps**: Unix timestamps as BIGINT
- **Payments**: nvarchar converted with TRY_CAST
- **Date Conversion**: DATEADD(SECOND, CAST([time] AS BIGINT), '1970-01-01')
